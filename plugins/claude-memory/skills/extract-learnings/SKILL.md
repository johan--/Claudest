## Memory Hierarchy

| Layer | File | Loaded | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 0 | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Every session, all projects | Universal behavioral preferences |
| 1 | `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` | Every session, this project | Architecture, conventions, gotchas |
| 2 | `memory/MEMORY.md` (project dir) | Every session, agent-managed | Evolving notes, working knowledge |
| 3 | `memory/*.md` topic files | On-demand | Detailed reference too long for L2 |
| Meta | Suggest new skill/command | N/A | Repeatable workflow → automation |

Placement decision: project-independent preference → L0, project-specific technical → L1, concise working note → L2, detailed reference → L3, repeatable pattern → Meta.

## Early Exit Guard

If the user said "remember X" with explicit content already in context — and the request is NOT a consolidation trigger ("consolidate", "dream", "extract learnings", "clean up memories", or triggered from the consolidation nudge):
1. Resolve memory path (see Phase 1 step 1)
2. Read existing memories to check for duplicates and pick the right layer
3. Skip to Phase 3 (Propose & Execute) with that content — no subagents needed

## Unified Workflow

### Phase 1: Orient (main session)

1. Resolve memory path: `Glob ~/.claude/projects/*<repo-dir-name>*/memory/MEMORY.md`
   - If MEMORY.md does not exist, create it with `# Project Memory` header. Note that the Memory Auditor has nothing to audit — in Phase 2, spawn only the Signal Discoverer.
2. Read MEMORY.md + list topic files (`Glob memory/*.md` from resolved path)
3. Read both CLAUDE.md files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`)
4. `git log --oneline -20`

Steps 2-4 can run as parallel tool calls.

5. Build context snapshot: summarize existing knowledge + list verification targets (file paths, functions, patterns named in memories)

### Phase 2: Gather (2 agents in parallel)

Launch both agent calls in a single message so they run in parallel. Use the Agent tool with:

- **Memory Auditor**: `subagent_type: "claude-memory:memory-auditor"`. In the `prompt`, include the context snapshot from Phase 1 — memory file contents, git log output, and verification targets list.

- **Signal Discoverer**: `subagent_type: "claude-memory:signal-discoverer"`. In the `prompt`, include existing memory summaries (for dedup) and the project name.

If Phase 1 noted MEMORY.md was just created (no existing memories), skip the Memory Auditor and spawn only the Signal Discoverer.

Phase 2 is complete when both agents return reports. If either returns empty, proceed with the other's results only.

### Phase 3: Synthesize & Propose (main session)

1. Receive agent reports
2. Deduplicate across reports and against existing memories
3. Rank by impact, limit to 3-7 candidates
4. For each candidate: determine target layer, target section, action (ADD / EDIT / REMOVE)
5. Read target files, check for duplicates
6. Present proposals:
   ```
   ### [ACTION] Learning: <summary>
   **Target:** <file> → <section>
   **Rationale:** <why this layer>
   ```diff
   - <old line>
   + <new line>
   ```
   ```
7. MEMORY.md line check — if over 170 lines, propose specific demotions to L3 or removals
8. Layer 0 gate — if targeting `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, warn: "This modifies global instructions loaded in every session across all projects. Confirm?"
9. AskUserQuestion: Approve all / Approve selectively / Reject

### Phase 4: Execute

Apply approved edits. Output summary table:

```
| Learning | Action | Target | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
```

Only if Phase 2 agents ran (not an early-exit capture): write consolidation marker `Bash(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` → Write `.last-consolidation` in same directory as MEMORY.md.

Phase 4 is complete when all approved edits are applied and the summary table is presented.

## Content Quality Rules

Every candidate must pass: (1) agent would benefit from knowing this in future sessions, (2) condensed to minimum useful form, (3) placed at correct layer, (4) not already captured in target file, (5) stated as reusable principle not session-specific incident.

Pass: commands discovered through trial-and-error, non-obvious gotchas, architectural decisions with rationale, user behavioral corrections, configuration quirks, version milestones.

Fail: information readable from code, generic best practices, one-off bugs without pattern, verbose explanations, duplicates, temporary state, unverified speculation, incidents without generalizable principle.
